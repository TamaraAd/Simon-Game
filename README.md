# 🎮 Simon Game

This is a classic **Simon Game** clone I built to practice **JavaScript**, **DOM manipulation**, and **game logic**. The goal of the game is to repeat the sequence of button presses as it grows with each level. Miss a move, and it’s game over!

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. A random color in the sequence flashes with a sound.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
4. Each level adds a new color to the sequence.
5. Make a mistake, and the game will reset!
